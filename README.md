# GPXtoAppleMaps

This project provides a simple web-based tool to convert GPX (GPS Exchange Format) files to Apple Maps route. It allows you to visualize a route from a GPX file directly in Apple Maps.

**Note:** The `<trkpt>` element must be present in the GPX file for the script to function correctly. The script uses the `<trkpt>` elements to extract the recorded track points and generate the Apple Maps link.

Here's an example of how the .gpx file created on Kurviger.de would be look in Apple Maps:
