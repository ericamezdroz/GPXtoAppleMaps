# GPXtoAppleMaps

This project provides a simple web-based tool to convert GPX (GPS Exchange Format) files to Apple Maps route. It allows you to visualize a route from a GPX file directly in Apple Maps.

**Note:** The <code><trkpt></code> element must be present in the GPX file for the script to function correctly. The script uses the <trkpt> elements to extract the recorded track points and generate the Apple Maps link.
